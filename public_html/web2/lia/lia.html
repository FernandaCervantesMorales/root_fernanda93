            <h2>Understand What your Friend Likes</h2>
            <p>If you wanna make a personalised gift for someone, you have to know what they like. What's their favourite color? What type of music do they like? What's their love language?</p>

            <p>You can base yourself off of gifts they've liked in the past, do they like expensive things or do they prefer something hand made?</p>

                <p>The card can have a color palette base off of the receiver's favourite color. It can have stickers or magazine cut outs that they would like.</p>

            <h2>Unique Packaging</h2>
            <p>Adding little touches</p>
            <h3>Examples</h3>
            <section>
                <p>My friend made a custom CD for his boyfriend. He made a playlist fill with music he and his boyfriend like and burned the CD himself. He also decorated the CD by making silly references to their scrapbooking activities and to his pets.</p>
                <figure>

                    <img src="./img/back_cd_yellow.jpg" alt="">
                </figure>
                <p>I hand made and sewed a sketch book for my friend. I decorated the first page with a picture of his cat, a few stickers that I designed myself and some doodle that make references to our friendship.</p>
                <figure>
                    <img src="./img/handmade_sketchbook.jpg" alt="">
                    <img src="./img/memory_arsene.jpg" alt="">
                </figure>
                <p>You don't always have to put our heart an soul into making something incredible. You can do something silly like my friend who decorated a lighter with magazine covers as a gift.</p>
